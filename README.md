This is the backend of NetPix, which is a modified netflix clone. (Access the frontend here: https://github.com/puifaiba/netpix-frontend )
Backend is based on Ruby on Rails.  
Makes calls to external APIs to retrieve movie and genre information, as well as persist user data.

To start up, run bundle to install all dependencies and then rails s to start up the server. 
Some keys were used to get data from 3rd party APIs.
